### A gist about me
Just a guy who wanders the planet and loves to learn new things.

- :eyes: I am looking for full-time opportunities in the field of machine learning, image processing, and software development
- :hammer:  I am working at [Dragonfruit AI](https://www.dragonfruit.ai/) as a Machine Learning Engineer
- :briefcase: I have experience in research, prototype, and deployment of machine learning models
- :blue_book: I have a master's degree in Electrical Engineering with a focus on machine learning from the University of Southern California
- :rocket: I love learning new stuff all the time, so if I don't know something today I will know it tomorrow
